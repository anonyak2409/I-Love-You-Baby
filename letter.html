                7 months of love and friendship feels like both yesterday and a lifetime ago. Through it all, you've been my rock, my partner in crime, my shoulder to cry (and rest my legs) on....Thank you for your neverending love, your unwavering support, your sweet infectious laughter, and your ability to comfort me and put up with me hehe.
                Thank you for existing, thank you for being you, and for being the bestesttttt hubby a person could ask for...Thank you for everything meri jaan, for the laughter, the tears, and the countless memories we've made together (and will keep making together)

                Your wifey
